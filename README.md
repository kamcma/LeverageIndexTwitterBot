# LeverageIndexTwitterBot
A Twitter bot that watches MLB games (Indians games, in my case) by polling the Gameday API and tweeting alerts during high-leverage game states.

Based on, but not associated with, Leverage Index calculcations by Tom Tango found here:

This repository excludes the App.config file because it contains private API keys.
